## 📊 Data

This project uses [dataset name/description], which includes features such as:

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location (zip code, neighborhood, etc.)
- Year built
- Lot size
- Special features (pool, garage, etc.)
- Historical sale prices

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.

## 🧠 Models

Several machine learning models were evaluated for this project:

1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model
2. **Random Forest**: For capturing non-linear relationships
3. **Gradient Boosting**: For improved accuracy
4. **Neural Networks**: For complex pattern recognition

The [best performing model] was selected based on metrics including RMSE, MAE, and R-squared values.
